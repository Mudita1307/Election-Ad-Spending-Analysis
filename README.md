# Election-Ad-Spending-Analysis
Have you ever wondered how much money political parties spend on social media ads to influence voters during elections? 
If you are highly active on Facebook or Instagram you may have noticed election related ads from various political parties, like BJP and INC. Political parties in India invest heavily in election campaigns, through digital advertisements.

In this project, we will examine the analysis of election ad spending using Python and its impact on voting patterns.
